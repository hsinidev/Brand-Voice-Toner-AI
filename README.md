# Brand-Voice-Toner-AI

üéôÔ∏è Brand Voice Toner: Dynamic AI RewriterThe Brand Voice Toner is a powerful, dynamically-themed desktop application that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to instantly rewrite any piece of text to match a specified brand voice (e.g., Witty, Professional, Playful).This tool is designed for content creators who need clean, structured content for any platform, from social media to WordPress.‚ú® Key FeaturesDual Output: Generates content simultaneously in two formats for ease of use:Plain Text: Clean, unformatted text ready for any document or email.HTML Code: Fully structured with tags (<p>, <h2>, <ul>, etc.) ready to paste directly into the WordPress Classic Editor.Dynamic Theming: Supports multiple color schemes (like "Pink Magic," "Mystic Blue," "Warlock Green") which can be switched instantly via the settings menu, along with standard Dark/Light mode support.Flexible Power Source: Works equally well using Ollama Local (using your PC's GPU/CPU for privacy and speed) or connecting to Ollama Cloud (using your cloud API key for greater model access).Persistent Settings: Automatically saves all user inputs, API keys, and theme preferences between sessions.Native Control: Includes a full right-click context menu (Cut, Copy, Paste) on all text fields.üíª Prerequisites: Getting StartedThis application requires Python and Ollama to be installed on your Windows PC.1. Install Python (Recommended Version: 3.11/3.12)If you still have Python 3.10, installing a newer, stable version is highly recommended.Download: Go to the official Python website and download the latest stable version (3.11 or newer).Install: During the installation process, check the box that says "Add python.exe to PATH".2. Install and Run OllamaThe application uses Ollama to access the LLMs.Install Ollama: Download and install the application for Windows from the Ollama website.Download a Model: Open your Command Prompt (CMD) or PowerShell and download the base model needed for text generation:ollama pull llama3:8b
Run Server: Ensure the Ollama server is running in the background before launching the app.‚öôÔ∏è Installation and SetupFollow these steps in your Command Prompt (CMD) or PowerShell.1. Clone the RepositoryClone this project from GitHub and navigate into the folder:git clone [YOUR GITHUB REPOSITORY URL HERE]
cd "Brand Voice Toner"
2. Create and Activate Virtual EnvironmentUse a virtual environment to manage dependencies cleanly:# Create the environment (Use py -3.11 if you installed Python 3.11)
python -m venv .venv

# Activate the environment (Use the correct script for your OS/Shell)
.venv\Scripts\activate 
3. Install DependenciesInstall the required libraries:pip install customtkinter ollama
4. Configure Theme Files (Critical Step)The application relies on two JSON files for its design and settings. These files must be present in the root directory.master_themes.json: Defines the colors for all themes (Pink, Blue, Green).toner_settings.json: This file will be created automatically when you first run the app, but you must ensure it has write permissions.‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the ApplicationEnsure your virtual environment is active.Run the main script:python toner_app.py
Using Cloud OllamaIf you wish to use your Ollama Cloud account for faster/larger models:Go to the Settings section of the running app.Select Cloud Ollama.Enter your Cloud API URL (usually https://ollama.com) and your Cloud API Key (obtained from the Ollama website).üì¶ Creating the Executable (.exe)To easily share your tool with non-technical users, use PyInstaller to create a single executable file.1. The Build CommandRun this command in your project folder (with the virtual environment active):pyinstaller --onefile --windowed ^
--name="BrandVoiceToner" ^
--add-data "master_themes.json;." ^
--add-data "toner_settings.json;." ^
toner_app.py
2. ResultYour final executable, BrandVoiceToner.exe, will be located in the newly created dist folder. This single file can be run anywhere on a Windows machine.
